This repository is dedicated to practicing algorithms and data structures through Baekjoon Online Judge problems.  

## Goals
- Solve at least one problem every day
- Improve problem-solving skills step by step
- Keep track of progress and share solutions

## Structure
Each file will contain the solution code for a specific problem, usually named by its problem number (e.g., `1000.java`, `2557.py`).
